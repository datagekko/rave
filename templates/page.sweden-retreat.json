Workshops and time spent in nature.<br/><br/>This October, we are retreating into the magical oasis that is our retreat location in Sweden. A magical house embedded in sprawling land on the Swedish countryside, only 45mins from Copenhagen. We will take a prolonged weekend to gather, celebrate the change of the seasons, and cultivate the light within us.<br/><br/>The house invites you to fully let go of the past and future — just embrace the energy of the land and the present moment. You will explore all the hidden corners of the house, practice yoga in the old ballroom, light a fire in the tipi by the private lake and sleep a deep, restful sleep. This experience is for all those who wish to rejuvenate, re-connect and fill their own cup as we transition to the colder months.<br/>You will have lots of space to sprawl out across the house, no matter the weather, or jump into our outdoor sauna.<br/><br/>We will start our mornings with prolonged yoga session - always with a different theme to tune into the day. You will receive a clear immersion into yoga postures, breathwork and meditation that is suited to your unique body and level of experience.<br/>The day will flow further with a beautiful sprawling brunch prepared indoors our outdoors by our wonderful chef Phoebe. You will have time to wander the forest, journal in your new magic of I journals and relax deeply. The afternoons are filled with workshops, yoga and lots of aromatherapy sauna. <br/>We will gather for delicious long-table dinners, enjoy sound healing with Jenny or a session by the fireplace in the Tipi behind the house.<br/><br/>Throughout the weekend, products from Rudolph Care will be available to use. Our sauna is provided by Heat Harmony. Drinks and snacks will be available to you at all times, and you will receive a rich goodie bag with a special retreat shirt as well as products from Basium, Cosmic Dealer, Magic of I and more.<br/><br/>Check-in: Friday between 10:00-12:00.<br/>Check-out: Sunday between 12:00–13:00.<br/><br/>Further information will be send out via email when signing up.<br/></p>"
