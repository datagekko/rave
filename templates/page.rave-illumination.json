For us, that means creating space to feel clear, energised, and more aligned with your vision for the year and your high-vibrational self. Through breath, sound, and intentional movement, we work with the body’s natural energy and nervous system to shift out of stagnation and into creation. The creative energy of our surroundings will be a channel for us to go deep.</p><p>We’ll explore this further through workshops, astrology, and guided journalling. Everything is designed to spark creativity and reconnect you to your sense of expression.</p>"
