Her classes are dynamic and usually include upbeat music with an indie influence. She loves to incorporate breathwork as well as aromatherapy into her classes. Her classes are open to all levels and focus on finding balance through deeper mental and physical connection with the self. Rather than doing yoga to be good at yoga, the approach is to do yoga to be better at 'doing' life.</p>",
